### About Me
Full stack developer, focused on mobile-first and responsive apps. Interested in tech education and AI literacy.

Currently developing Flutter applications with complex business logic, responsive and pixel-perfect interfaces, integrated with local SQLite databases and organized using a micro-frontend architecture with Flutter packages.

I also work on backend development using Python with Flask and SQLAlchemy, integrating PostgreSQL and implementing AI features with LangChain. In this context, I apply practical concepts such as prompt engineering, token optimization, and vector database integration.

I have prior experience in full-stack projects using Node.js (Express) on the backend and HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript on the frontend.
